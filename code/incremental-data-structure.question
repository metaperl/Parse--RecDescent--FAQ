I have a data structure which is

a hash of entries
where
an entry is a list/array of sets

I have also a grammar that can parse the syntax of the text files that
contain the data I want to fill this structure with. Until here
everything is ok.

Problem: I cannot figure out how to actually FILL the parsed data into
the structure. I can only decide if a string is grammatically correct
or not.
