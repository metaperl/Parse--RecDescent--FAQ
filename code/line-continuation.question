I need to parse a grammar that includes line continuation
characters.  For example:

 // COMMAND ARG1-VALUE,ARG2-VALUE, +
    ARG3-VALUE,ARG4-VALUE, +
    EVEN-MORE-ARGS
 // ANOTHERCOMMAND
 * and a comment
 * or two

How do I formulate a rule (or rules) to treat the first command
as if all 5 arguments were specified on a single line?  I need to
skip over the /\s*+\n\s*/ sequence.  It seems like skip or resync
should do this for me, but if so, I haven't discovered the
correct technique, yet.
